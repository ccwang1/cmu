Snake Tower Defense readme - Charles Wang

My project is a tower defense game that uses only Tkinter to run. To play the game, simply initiate the game with the Game() function.

On the start menu, you can either start the game with the default map or create your own with the map editor. With the map editor, simply click anywhere on the map and then connect additional pieces to create the new map. If you really like your map, you can save it and use it the next time you play. Otherwise, if you decide you didâ€™t like it, you can reset it to the original map.
